            <h3>Working on cars</h3>
            <p>
              Ever since I was a kid, cars have always appealed to me. I would help
              my dad do oil changes, change spark plugs, and clean his 2001 Honda Accord.
              I thank him for sparking my interest in cars.

            <h3>Soccer</h3>
            <p>
              My interest in soccer started in 5th grade when I decided to join my school's
              soccer team. I always liked soccer primarily beause my whole family did and still 
              do. However, when I joined, I became addicted to it. It was sort of a sweet escape 
              from reality.
